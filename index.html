      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As someone who spends as much time as I do on the computer, I realized that building a career out of it was the right decision. Since after highschool, all I have known is the restaurant business. This was very limiting to my creative side. After becoming a manager for a short time and creating flyers and menus, I found out that web design was the right calling for me. Not only do I get to test my creative side, but also being able to interact with different minds from all around the world and creating new things with new people is what appeals to me most.</p>
      <p>Becoming a developer will help me create websites to display my true passions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taking photos from around the world.
        <li>Blogging about different cultures and their foods.
        <li>Creative photography.
      </ul>
      <p>Discovering Thinkful helped me realize how achievable these goals were, and I am very excited in my journey to becoming a software engineer. </p>
